# Strata

**Content-addressed notebooks for ML and data workflows.**

Strata Notebook is an interactive notebook where every cell output is an
artifact. Same code + same inputs = instant cache hit. Change one cell,
and only that cell and its dependents re-execute — everything else is
served from the artifact store in milliseconds.

## Strata Notebook

An interactive notebook with content-addressed caching, automatic
dependency tracking, and cascade execution. Each cell output is an
artifact. Change upstream code, and downstream cells automatically
invalidate — but everything that hasn't changed is served instantly
from cache.

**Key features:**

- Content-addressed caching (same code + inputs = cache hit)
- Automatic DAG from variable analysis
- Distributed workers (`@worker gpu-fly` dispatches to remote GPU)
- Prompt cells with `{{ variable }}` LLM injection
- AI assistant with streaming chat and agent mode
- Per-notebook Python environments via uv
- Headless runner (`strata run`) for CI

## Strata Core

The notebook is built on Strata Core — a standalone materialization
and artifact layer. Core can also be used independently as a Python
client library and REST API for any workflow that needs provenance-based
caching, lineage tracking, or Iceberg table scanning.

```python
from strata import StrataClient

client = StrataClient()
artifact = client.materialize(
    inputs=["file:///warehouse#db.events"],
    transform={"executor": "scan@v1", "params": {}},
)
table = client.fetch(artifact.uri)
```

## Quick Start

=== "Docker"

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```

    Then open [http://localhost:8765](http://localhost:8765).

=== "From source"

    ```bash
    uv sync
    cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build && cd ..
    uv run strata-server
    ```

    Then open [http://localhost:8765](http://localhost:8765).

See [Installation](getting-started/installation.md) for full details.

## Status

Strata is currently in **alpha**. Both surfaces (Notebook and Core) are
functional but the API may change before 1.0.
