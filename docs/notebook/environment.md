# Environment Management

Each notebook has its own isolated Python environment managed by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

## How It Works

When you create a notebook, Strata:

1. Generates a `pyproject.toml` with `pyarrow` as the default dependency
2. Runs `uv sync` to create a `.venv/` and `uv.lock`
3. All cell execution uses this notebook-local venv

The environment lockfile hash (`sha256(uv.lock)`) participates in provenance. Changing the environment invalidates all cached cell outputs.

## Python Version

At notebook creation time, you can select a Python version from the versions configured on the server. The default is the server's own Python version.

!!! note
    The available versions depend on the server's `STRATA_NOTEBOOK_PYTHON_VERSIONS` configuration. On the hosted preview, both 3.12 and 3.13 are available.

## Installing Packages

### From the UI

Open the **Environment** panel in the sidebar. Type a package name and click **Add**.

```
pandas>=2.0
scikit-learn
matplotlib
```

The operation runs asynchronously — you can continue editing cells while it installs.

### Import from requirements.txt

In the Environment panel, click **Import** and paste a `requirements.txt`:

```
pandas>=2.0
numpy>=2.0
scikit-learn>=1.5
matplotlib>=3.9
seaborn>=0.13
```

Strata previews the changes (additions, removals, unchanged) before applying.

### Import from environment.yaml

Conda-style `environment.yaml` files are supported on a best-effort basis. Strata extracts `pip` dependencies and ignores conda-specific packages.

### Export

Click **Export** to download the current dependencies as `requirements.txt`.

## Environment Operations

All environment mutations run as **async jobs** with four actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `add` | Install a new package |
| `remove` | Remove a package |
| `sync` | Rebuild the environment from `pyproject.toml` |
| `import` | Bulk import from requirements.txt or environment.yaml |

The UI shows:

- Current job status (running, success, failed)
- Recent operation history (persisted across server restarts)
- Resolved package count and lockfile hash

## Cache Invalidation

When you install or remove a package:

1. `uv sync` runs to update `uv.lock`
2. The lockfile hash changes
3. All cells become **stale** (their provenance no longer matches)
4. Re-running any cell recomputes with the new environment

!!! info "Switching back"
    If you remove a package and then re-add it (returning to the same `uv.lock`), the original provenance hashes match again and cells get **cache hits**. This is free by construction — no special logic needed.

## Missing Package Detection

When a cell fails with `ModuleNotFoundError`, Strata detects the missing package and offers a one-click install button:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'
→ [Install pandas]
```

## File Layout

```
my_notebook/
├── pyproject.toml    # Package declarations
├── uv.lock           # Locked dependency graph
└── .venv/            # Virtual environment (auto-created, not committed)
```

The `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` are the source of truth. The `.venv/` is recreated by `uv sync` when needed.
