# Cell Annotations & Environment

Annotations are metadata directives written in the leading comment block of a cell. They control display names, execution routing, timeouts, environment variables, and filesystem mounts — without separate configuration UI. The cell source is the single source of truth.

```python
# @name Train Classifier
# @worker my-gpu
# @timeout 120
# @env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
x = embeddings
y = labels
classifier.fit(x, y)
```

Annotations are parsed from the **first contiguous block** of `#`-prefixed lines. Once a non-comment, non-blank line is encountered, parsing stops. Each annotation is one line in the format `# @key value`.

---

## @name

Set a human-readable display name for the cell. Shown in the DAG view and as a badge in the cell editor.

```python
# @name Load arXiv Papers
import pandas as pd
papers = pd.read_parquet("https://...")
```

For **Python cells**, any non-empty string is accepted — spaces, parentheses, and special characters are fine.

For **prompt cells**, `@name` also sets the output variable name and must be a valid Python identifier:

```
# @name research_themes
Given these paper counts: {{ category_stats }}
Identify 3 research themes.
```

If no `@name` is set, the DAG view falls back to showing the cell's defined variable names, then the cell ID.

---

## @worker

Route the cell's execution to a named worker instead of the local machine.

```python
# @worker df-cluster
category_stats = ctx.sql("SELECT topic, COUNT(*) FROM papers GROUP BY topic").to_pandas()
```

Workers are HTTP endpoints that implement the Strata executor protocol. Register them via the **Workers panel** in the sidebar — the persisted result lands in `notebook.toml` as:

```toml
[[workers]]
name = "df-cluster"
backend = "executor"
runtime_id = "df-cluster"

[workers.config]
url = "https://my-datafusion-worker.fly.dev/v1/execute"
transport = "http"
```

During execution, the UI shows a pulsing "dispatching → df-cluster" badge on the cell. After completion, the worker name appears in the cell's metadata.

Workers can be anything that speaks HTTP: a GPU box on RunPod, a DataFusion cluster on Fly, a beefy EC2 instance, or a local process on a different port. The built-in `remote_executor.py` provides a reference implementation:

```bash
python -m strata.notebook.remote_executor --port 9000
```

If no `@worker` is set, the cell runs locally in the notebook's Python environment.

---

## @timeout

Override the execution timeout for a single cell, in seconds. The default is 30 seconds.

```python
# @timeout 300
# @worker my-gpu
embeddings = model.encode(abstracts, batch_size=256)
```

Useful for cells that download data, train models, or call slow external APIs. The timeout applies to the full execution including any remote worker round-trip.

---

## @env

Set an environment variable for this cell only, overriding the notebook-level value.

```python
# @env CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
# @env OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
import torch
model = torch.nn.Linear(384, 10).cuda()
```

Format: `# @env KEY=value`. Multiple `@env` lines are supported. The variable is available in `os.environ` during cell execution.

---

## @mount

Attach a filesystem mount to the cell. Mounts provide read or read-write access to external storage (S3, local paths) during execution.

```python
# @mount raw_data s3://my-bucket/dataset ro
# @mount scratch file:///tmp/work rw
df = pd.read_parquet("/mnt/raw_data/events.parquet")
```

Format: `# @mount <name> <uri> [ro|rw]`. Defaults to `ro` (read-only) if the mode is omitted. The mount name must be a valid Python identifier.

---

## Prompt Cell Annotations

Prompt cells (language `prompt`) accept an additional set of annotations that
configure the LLM call.

### `@model`

Override the notebook-level LLM model for this cell only.

```
# @model claude-sonnet-4-20250514
Summarize {{ df }} in one paragraph.
```

### `@temperature`

Sampling temperature. Defaults to `0.0`.

```
# @temperature 0.3
```

### `@max_tokens`

Ceiling on output tokens for this call.

```
# @max_tokens 1024
```

### `@system`

System prompt prepended to the conversation.

```
# @system You are a terse data analyst. Answer in bullet points.
```

Multiple `@system` lines are concatenated with newlines.

### `@output`

Force the response format.

```
# @output json
```

Currently supports `json`. Auto-applied when `@output_schema` is set.

### `@output_schema`

Inline JSON Schema pinning the response shape. When provided, Strata
dispatches to provider-native structured output (OpenAI's `json_schema` with
strict mode; Anthropic's native tool-use) so the response comes back as
validated JSON rather than free-form text. Providers without schema support
fall back to `json_object` — valid JSON, shape not enforced — and the
`@validate_retries` loop catches shape violations.

```
# @output_schema {"type": "object", "properties": {"themes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["themes"]}
```

Editing the schema invalidates the cell's cache — the schema is part of the
provenance hash.

### `@validate_retries`

Total attempts for the validate-and-retry loop (1 initial call + N-1 retries).
Defaults to 3. Only takes effect when `@output_schema` is set; each failed
validation feeds the prior response and path-addressed errors back as a retry
turn.

```
# @validate_retries 5
```

---

## Loop Cell Annotations

A Python cell carrying `@loop` is executed iteratively. The body runs once per
iteration and the `carry` variable threads state between them.

### `@loop`

```python
# @loop max_iter=50 carry=state
# @loop_until state["converged"]
state = state if "state" in dir() else initial
state = step(state)
```

Key/value parameters:

- `max_iter=<N>` — hard upper bound on iterations.
- `carry=<var>` — the variable threaded between iterations.
- `start_from=<cell>@iter=<k>` — (optional) resume from another loop cell's
  stored iteration `k`. Useful for forking a converged run to explore a
  variant.

### `@loop_until`

Python expression evaluated after each iteration in the cell's namespace. When
it returns truthy, the loop exits early.

```python
# @loop max_iter=100 carry=acc
# @loop_until acc["loss"] < 0.05
```

Each iteration's carry state is stored as `…@iter=k` artifacts; the final
iteration becomes the cell's canonical artifact. Progress is broadcast over
WebSocket as `cell_iteration_progress` messages.

## SQL Cell Annotations

A cell with `language = "sql"` runs a query through a declared connection.
See [SQL Cells](cells.md#sql-cells) for the full feature walkthrough; this
section is the per-annotation reference.

### `@sql`

Marks the cell as SQL and binds it to a named connection.

```sql
# @sql connection=warehouse
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE amount > :min_amount
```

Key/value parameters:

- `connection=<name>` — required. Must reference an entry under
  `[connections.<name>]` in `notebook.toml`. Manage these via the
  **Connections panel** in the sidebar; you don't need to edit the file
  directly.
- `write=true` — opt the cell into writable execution. Without this flag,
  the connection is opened in enforced read-only mode (SQLite `mode=ro` +
  `PRAGMA query_only=ON`; PostgreSQL `SET default_transaction_read_only =
  on`) and any DDL/DML errors before mutating the database. With it, the
  cell can run setup scripts (`CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `DROP`). The flag
  is per-cell — read cells using the same connection stay read-only.

```sql
# @sql connection=warehouse write=true
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS events;
CREATE TABLE events (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, label TEXT NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO events VALUES (1, 'alpha'), (2, 'beta');
```

Write cells split the body into individual statements via sqlglot, run each
in sequence, and emit a per-statement status table (`stmt`, `kind`,
`rows_affected`). Default cache policy for write cells is `session`;
`fingerprint` and `snapshot` error early because probe-based invalidation
has no anchor when the cell mutates state.

### `@cache`

Override the default `fingerprint` cache policy on a SQL cell.

| Policy            | Behavior                                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `fingerprint`     | Default. Probe-derived freshness token + schema fingerprint folded into the hash. |
| `forever`         | Static salt; never invalidates from DB-side state.           |
| `session`         | Session-unique salt; invalidates across sessions.            |
| `ttl=<seconds>`   | `floor(now / ttl)` bucketed time-based salt.                 |
| `snapshot`        | Probe MUST return a durable snapshot ID. Errors at execute time when the driver can't (SQLite/Postgres can't; Iceberg-via-engine can). |

```sql
# @sql connection=warehouse
# @cache forever
SELECT * FROM dim_country
```

`# @cache snapshot` requires `AdapterCapabilities.supports_snapshot = True`
on the driver; otherwise the resolver fails fast before any connection is
opened. Per-driver freshness probe details are in
[SQL Cells](cells.md#per-driver-freshness).

### `@name`

For SQL cells, `@name` sets the output variable name (default `result`),
the same way it does for prompt cells.

```sql
# @sql connection=warehouse
# @name top_customers
SELECT customer, SUM(amount) AS total
FROM orders GROUP BY customer ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 5
```

A downstream Python cell can then reference `top_customers` directly as a
pandas DataFrame.

---

## Cross-Cell Ordering

### `@after`

Add an ordering-only DAG edge from another cell to this one. Useful when the
dependency is on a side effect — e.g. a SQL `seed` cell creates the database
state that subsequent SQL cells query — and no Python variable flows
between them.

```sql
# @sql connection=warehouse
# @after seed
SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM products GROUP BY category
```

Multiple `@after` lines stack; each cell ID adds one edge. Whitespace-
separated IDs on a single line work too: `# @after seed migrate`. Self-
references and unknown cell IDs are silently dropped at the DAG layer
(annotation_validation surfaces them as a diagnostic for the user).

The edge participates in upstream/downstream wiring and the topological
order, but contributes no variable to `consumed_variables` — so it
doesn't affect per-variable provenance hashes.

---

## Precedence Rules

When the same setting is configured at multiple levels, the most specific wins:

| Setting | Annotation | Cell config (notebook.toml) | Notebook default |
|---------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Worker** | `# @worker X` | `cell.worker` field | `notebook.worker` field |
| **Timeout** | `# @timeout N` | `cell.timeout` field | 30 seconds |
| **Env vars** | `# @env K=V` | `cell.env` overrides | `notebook.env` defaults |
| **Mounts** | `# @mount ...` | `cell.mounts` overrides | `notebook.mounts` defaults |
| **SQL connection** | `# @sql connection=X` | — | none — required for SQL cells |
| **Cache policy** | `# @cache <policy>` | — | `fingerprint` (read), `session` (write) |

Annotations always take priority. This lets you override per-cell behavior without editing `notebook.toml`.

---

## Notebook-Level Environment (Runtime Panel)

Notebook-wide environment variables are set via the **Runtime panel** in the sidebar. These apply to all cells unless overridden by a cell-level `@env` annotation.

Common use cases:

- **API keys**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (for prompt cells and AI assistant)
- **Database URLs**: `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`
- **Feature flags**: `DEBUG=true`, `LOG_LEVEL=info`

!!! note "Sensitive values are not persisted to disk"
    Environment variables with names containing KEY, SECRET, TOKEN, PASSWORD, or CREDENTIAL have their values blanked from `notebook.toml` when saving. The key names are preserved as a "which vars are configured" reminder *only* when something real is configured alongside them. A notebook whose `[env]` would contain nothing but blanked sensitive slots is persisted without an `[env]` block at all — so typing an API key in the Runtime panel doesn't churn the committed notebook.

Notebook env vars are stored in the `[env]` section of `notebook.toml`:

```toml
[env]
DATABASE_URL = "postgres://localhost/mydb"
OPENAI_API_KEY = ""  # value blanked; name kept because DATABASE_URL above is real config
```
