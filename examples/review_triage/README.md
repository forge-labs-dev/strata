# Review Triage — Structured Prompt Output

Demonstrates `# @output_schema` on a prompt cell.

The `triage` cell sends a list of customer reviews to an LLM and gets
back a **schema-validated JSON array** — not free-form text that a
downstream cell has to regex. The schema is passed through as native
structured-output (OpenAI's `response_format: {type: "json_schema"}`,
or `json_object` fallback for providers that don't support schemas).

Because the schema is part of the cell's provenance hash, editing the
schema invalidates the cached response — exactly what you want when
you're iterating on the shape of the output.

## Cells

1. `reviews.py` — hand-picked list of customer reviews
2. `triage.py` — prompt cell with `@output_schema` enforcing
   `{sentiment, priority, tags}` per review
3. `summary.py` — pandas aggregation of the structured results

## Running

Set an API key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.) in the
notebook's Runtime panel, then run-all.
