# Generate sentence-transformer embeddings for each paper's abstract.
# This is the expensive step: ~3K abstracts × 384-dim on an A10G GPU
# takes ~5 seconds. On CPU it would take ~90 seconds. On re-run it's
# instant — the artifact store caches the result keyed by the exact
# input data + model identity.
