# @name Seed State
# Seed the hill-climb search from a random point on Himmelblau's
# surface. ``random`` and ``himmelblau`` come from the helpers cell
# via the DAG — reusing them here keeps the example DRY and shows how
# a module cell's definitions flow through to runtime cells.

    "best_score": score,
    # Step size shrinks each accepted move so the search sharpens as
    # it approaches a minimum.
    "step": 1.0,
    # history accumulates every proposal (accepted or rejected) so
    # the summary cell can show the whole trajectory, not just the
    # kept moves.
