# A "module cell" — contains only imports and definitions, no top-level
# runtime state. Strata treats this kind of cell as a shareable module
# so downstream cells can ``import random`` / call ``himmelblau`` just
# by referencing the names. Mixing imports/defs with runtime state
# (``x = random.uniform(...)``) in the same cell blocks the share.
