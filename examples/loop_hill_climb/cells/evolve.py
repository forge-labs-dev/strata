# @name Hill Climb
# @loop max_iter=40 carry=state
# @loop_until state["best_score"] < 1e-3
#
# One iteration of greedy hill climbing on Himmelblau's function:
# perturb (x, y) by a small random step, keep the move if it strictly
# improves the score, otherwise record the proposal and keep the
# current best. The step size shrinks after every accepted move so the
# search naturally sharpens as it approaches a minimum.
#
# Every iteration stores the full `state` as its own artifact with an
# ``@iter=k`` suffix — the inspect panel's iteration picker lets you
# open any of them, and the returned URI can be pasted into a new
# loop cell's ``# @loop start_from=<cell>@iter=<k>`` to fork a
# different search strategy from a promising mid-iter state.
#
# `random` and `himmelblau` come from the seed cell via the DAG — no
# need to re-import or redefine here.

# Deterministic per-iteration RNG so the whole notebook is reproducible.
# random.Random only accepts int/str/bytes seeds on Python 3.11+, so we
# hash a per-iteration tuple down to an int.
