Example 5: DuckDB Integration

This example shows how to use Strata with DuckDB for SQL queries.
Data is fetched from Strata once at registration time and materialized
as an Arrow table that DuckDB can query with SQL.

What you'll learn:
    - How to register Strata tables as DuckDB views
    - How to run SQL queries against Iceberg tables via Strata
    - Difference between Strata-side and DuckDB-side filtering

Important: DuckDB SQL filters (WHERE clauses) are applied *after* data is
fetched from Strata. For Strata-side pruning, pass filters to register().
