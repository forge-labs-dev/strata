# @name Cost ledger
# Aggregates the ``costs`` table so the next cell can subtract the
# right number from P&L. Also produces a human-readable per-source
# breakdown and a running daily total.
#
# Depends on ``positions_snapshot`` so the DAG orders us after
# reconcile — otherwise costs posted during reconciliation
# (slippage deltas) would miss this aggregation.
