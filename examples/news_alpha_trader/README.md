# News Alpha Trader

**An end-to-end LLM-driven trading notebook.** Overnight news → structured sentiment signals → paper (or live) orders via Alpaca → cost-adjusted P&L, all persisted to a local DuckDB so the data accumulates across sessions.

This example is the opposite of the toy notebooks in this directory — it talks to real APIs, spends real tokens, and (if you opt in) places real orders.

## What it does

1. Pulls overnight news for a watchlist (Alpaca Market Data — Benzinga feed)
2. Extracts structured sentiment per headline via the LLM with `@output_schema` (validated JSON, auto-retried on failure)
3. Fetches latest prices and computes available capital
4. Generates a trade plan under hard risk limits (max position size, daily trade cap, ticker whitelist)
5. Submits orders — paper by default, live only behind a two-key lock
6. Reconciles fills, records realized costs (slippage, TAF, spread)
7. Reports **cost-adjusted** P&L — the only number that matters: did the strategy beat its own API and transaction bill?
8. LLM writes a daily journal entry with the day's lessons

## Required API keys

Set these in the **Runtime panel**:

| Key                   | Used for                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `ALPACA_API_KEY`      | News + prices + orders                |
| `ALPACA_API_SECRET`   | Same                                  |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` _or_ `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Signal extraction + daily note |

Alpaca free tier gives 200 req/min, 7+ years history, 15-min REST delay. Plenty for daily rebalancing.

## Paper vs live

**The notebook ships in `paper` mode.** Every code path is identical between paper and live; only the Alpaca endpoint URL differs. To flip to live you must:

1. Edit `helpers.py` → set `Config.MODE = "live"`
2. Edit `helpers.py` → set `Config.I_UNDERSTAND_THIS_IS_REAL_MONEY = True`
3. Your Alpaca account must be funded

The `place_orders` cell refuses to run live without both flags set. This is intentional — two edits on purpose.

## Risk limits (hard, enforced in code)

Change in `helpers.py` → `Config` class:

- `MAX_POSITION_USD` — per-ticker notional cap (default $500)
- `MAX_TOTAL_EXPOSURE_USD` — portfolio notional cap (default $2000)
- `MAX_DAILY_TRADES` — daily trade count cap (default 10)
- `TICKER_WHITELIST` — the LLM *cannot* place orders in tickers outside this list, even if a headline mentions one

## DuckDB schema

One file: `trading.db` next to the notebook. Tables:

- `news_raw` — raw headlines (idempotent insert by `article_id`)
- `signals` — extracted sentiment per article
- `prices` — daily OHLC per ticker
- `orders` — every order attempt, expected cost, Alpaca order id
- `trades` — reconciled fills with realized cost
- `positions` — current positions (rebuilt from `trades`)
- `costs` — every dollar spent: LLM tokens, market data, commissions, TAF fees, slippage

## Running

```bash
uv sync
# Open the notebook in Strata, set API keys in the Runtime panel, run-all.
```

Re-run tomorrow — `fetch_news` only pulls new articles, `place_orders` is idempotent by `signal_id`. The DB grows over time; so does the history you can analyze.

## ⚠️ Disclaimers

- **This is not financial advice.** The strategy is a demo. It may lose money. Backtest thoroughly before live trading.
- LLM outputs are non-deterministic even with `temperature=0.0`. A prompt injection in a news headline could theoretically shift a signal — the ticker whitelist is the hard backstop.
- Paper fills are instantaneous and slippage-free. Live fills are not. The cost model applies estimated slippage to both modes so the numbers stay honest.
- You are responsible for understanding every line of `place_orders.py` before flipping to live.
