# Limitations

Slicing has a hard rule: the synthetic module is built from **one cell's
source only** — it can't reach across cells to find names. Three failure
modes follow from that:

1. **Closures over runtime values.** A helper that references a value
   computed at runtime in the same cell can't be exported, because
   that value won't exist when the synthetic module re-executes.
2. **Cross-cell imports.** `import math` in cell A doesn't make `math`
   visible inside a helper exported by cell B — each cell that hosts
   library code has to carry its own imports.
3. **Cross-cell helpers.** A helper can't call another helper that
   lives in a different cell. Move them into the same cell, or
   duplicate the dependency.

The next cell triggers the first failure mode on purpose so you can see
the diagnostic — it should error with a message naming the unresolved
variable.
