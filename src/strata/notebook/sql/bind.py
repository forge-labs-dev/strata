"""Bind-parameter resolution and coercion for SQL cells.

Strata's SQL cells use ``:name`` placeholders that resolve against
upstream cell variables. This module:

1. Looks up each placeholder name in the upstream namespace.
2. Type-checks the value against an explicit allowlist of accepted
   Python types.
3. Returns an ordered tuple ready for ADBC's parameter-binding API.

Critically, we never do string substitution. Values flow as ADBC bind
parameters through the driver's native parameter API. That is the
entire injection-defense story — adversarial strings (``'; DROP TABLE
users; --``) round-trip as ordinary string parameters because the
backend's prepared-statement layer escapes them.

Accepted types
--------------

- ``None``
- ``bool`` (checked before ``int`` because ``True`` is also an ``int``;
  preserving type identity matters for the provenance hash)
- ``int``
- ``float``
- ``str``
- ``bytes`` (``bytearray`` is coerced to ``bytes`` for hash stability;
  ADBC drivers don't universally accept ``bytearray``)
- ``decimal.Decimal``
- ``uuid.UUID``
- ``datetime.datetime`` / ``datetime.date`` / ``datetime.time``

Anything else (lists, dicts, dataclasses, numpy scalars, pandas
``Timestamp``, custom objects) raises ``BindError``. Strictness here
is deliberate: numpy/pandas types have surprising overflow and
nullability behavior that ADBC drivers handle inconsistently. Users
convert explicitly with ``int(x)`` / ``x.to_pydatetime()`` and the
intent is visible in the cell.

Subclass strictness uses ``type(value) in _ACCEPTED_TYPES`` rather
than ``isinstance``, so a user-subclassed ``MyInt(int)`` and a
``pandas.Timestamp`` (which extends ``datetime``) are rejected with a
clear error rather than silently coerced.

    ``placeholders`` is the sequence the analyzer extracted from the
    SQL body. Each name is looked up in ``namespace`` (the resolved
    upstream-variable map for the cell) and type-checked. The return
    is a positional tuple in the same order as ``placeholders`` —
    suitable for the executor's later step of rewriting ``:name`` to
    the driver's native positional form (``?`` for SQLite, ``$1`` for
    Postgres) and passing the tuple to ADBC.

    Raises ``BindError`` if any name is missing from the namespace or
    has an unsupported type. The first failure short-circuits;
    we don't accumulate diagnostics here because the executor's job
    is to fail fast — the analyzer's diagnostic pass already shows
    the user every missing reference up front.

    Duplicate names are resolved independently. The analyzer dedupes
    its ``references`` list (so the DAG doesn't carry duplicates),
    but if a caller passes duplicates anyway, every position in
    ``placeholders`` produces one entry in the output.
