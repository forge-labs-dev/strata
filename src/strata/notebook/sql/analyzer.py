"""Analyzer for SQL-type notebook cells.

Extracts the cell's metadata (``# @sql connection=``, ``# @cache``,
``# @name``), the SQL body, ``:name`` bind placeholders, and — when a
dialect is supplied — the set of tables the query touches via sqlglot.

Bind placeholders use ``:name`` syntax universally, regardless of the
backend dialect. Strata maps them to the correct ADBC binding form at
execute time (``?`` for SQLite, ``$1`` for Postgres, etc.). The
analyzer doesn't need to know the dialect to find them.

Table extraction does need a dialect — same SQL parses to different
trees in different dialects. When the connection isn't declared yet
(or the chosen driver isn't registered), table extraction is skipped
and ``parse_error`` stays None; the executor will pick this up later
with the resolved dialect.
