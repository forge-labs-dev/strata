"""DuckDB driver adapter (embedded, file-backed).

Backed by the ``duckdb`` Python package's native DBAPI surface — not
ADBC. DuckDB ships its own first-class DBAPI driver that's stricter
about types than the ADBC bridge and exposes ``read_only=True`` at
``connect`` time directly. Skipping the ADBC translation layer
removes a moving part for a driver that already speaks Arrow
natively.

Scope: embedded mode only (path-based ``ConnectionSpec``). MotherDuck
and other remote modes are out of scope for this slice — they need
token-based auth in identity hashing and different freshness
semantics. They'll plug in as a separate adapter when needed.

Read-only enforcement is layered, mirroring SQLite:

1. **File-handle level** — file-backed connections open with
   ``read_only=True``; the engine refuses ``INSERT``/``UPDATE``/
   ``DELETE``/DDL.
2. **Session level** — every read-only open also opens a
   ``BEGIN TRANSACTION READ ONLY`` so an in-memory database (where
   ``read_only=True`` doesn't apply because there's no file to lock)
   still rejects writes at statement time.

Freshness is DB-wide (mirrors SQLite). DuckDB doesn't expose a
per-table change counter natively; we hash ``PRAGMA database_size``
output which advances when blocks are written. Acceptable for the
common "one DB per notebook" case; documented as a limitation.

Schema fingerprint is per-table via the ``duckdb_columns()``
function — catches metadata-only changes the freshness probe would
miss.

See ``docs/internal/design-sql-cells.md`` for the broader rationale.

           before it touches storage. Cursors spawned from this

           catches in-memory databases (``:memory:``) where
           ``read_only=True`` cannot apply because the database is
           created on demand, plus any future quirk where the file
           flag might not propagate.
