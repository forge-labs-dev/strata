"""SQLite driver adapter.

Backed by ``adbc-driver-sqlite``. The freshness probe combines
``PRAGMA data_version`` (database-wide write counter) with
``PRAGMA schema_version`` (DDL counter); both are DB-wide rather than
per-table because SQLite doesn't expose per-table change tracking.
The schema fingerprint is still per-table — column structure lives
in ``pragma_table_info``.

Read-only enforcement uses SQLite's URI ``mode=ro`` so the connection
is opened against an immutable DB handle; any ``INSERT`` / ``UPDATE``
/ ``DELETE`` is rejected at the engine before reaching disk.

See ``docs/internal/design-sql-cells.md`` for the SQLite-specific
gotcha list, especially: ``data_version`` only increments on writes
from *other* connections (Phase 1 SQL cells are read-only, so
self-writes that would defeat the probe aren't possible from cells).
