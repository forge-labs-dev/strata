"""Built-in SQL driver adapters.

Each adapter module exposes a ``register()`` callable that adds its
``DriverAdapter`` to the global registry. ``register_default_adapters``
imports each built-in module and calls ``register()``.

**Driver-module convention**: a built-in driver module MUST keep its
ADBC package import lazy (inside ``open()`` or behind a guard) so
importing the module always succeeds, even when the optional ADBC
package isn't installed. The adapter still registers; ``open()``
raises a clear ``RuntimeError`` at execute time with the install hint.

This convention means we don't need to swallow ``ImportError`` here —
a real bug in a driver module surfaces immediately instead of being
masked as "driver unavailable."
