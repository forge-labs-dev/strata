"""Provenance hash and ``# @cache`` policy resolution for SQL cells.

Strata's whole architecture rests on stable cache identity. For SQL
cells the hash needs to capture not just query text and bind values,
but also "what database state did this query see" to the strongest
degree the backend can expose. This module computes that hash and
implements the ``# @cache`` policy that controls how DB-side state
factors in.

Hash composition::

    provenance_hash = H(
        query_normalized,         # sqlglot pretty-print, dialect-aware
        bind_params,              # type-tagged tuple of resolved values
        connection_id,            # canonical non-secret connection identity
        upstream_input_hashes,    # variables referenced in :placeholders
        cache_salt,               # policy-derived static salt
        freshness_token,          # per-driver data-change token (or None)
        schema_fingerprint,       # touched-table column structure (or None)
    )

Note this differs from ``docs/internal/design-sql-cells.md``'s
original sketch by *omitting* a generic ``source_hash``. For Python
cells, ``compute_source_hash`` AST-normalizes the body so cosmetic
edits don't churn the cache. For SQL bodies ``ast.parse`` fails and
that helper falls back to a line-strip — which would re-introduce
exactly the whitespace / comment churn that ``normalize_query``
already strips. ``query_normalized`` *is* the SQL equivalent of an
AST-normalized form; folding a separate weak-normalization hash on
top would defeat the cosmetic-edit goal. The non-body parts of a
SQL cell source (``# @sql connection=...``, ``# @cache ...``, the
``# @name`` override) are captured by ``connection_id`` and
``cache_salt`` already; ``# @name`` doesn't affect data identity
(rename creates a new artifact-name pointer to the same hash).

Policy resolution lives here too because the policy decides which
slots get filled how — ``forever`` skips the freshness/schema probe
entirely, ``snapshot`` requires the token to be ``is_snapshot=True``,
``ttl`` adds a time bucket to the salt instead of probing, etc.
