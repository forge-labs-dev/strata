"""SQL cell support for Strata notebooks.

Public surface:
- ``DriverAdapter`` — protocol every backend implements
- ``AdapterCapabilities`` — capability flags (per-table fingerprint,
  snapshot support, separate probe-conn requirement)
- ``QualifiedTable`` — fully qualified table reference (catalog.schema.name)
- ``FreshnessToken`` / ``SchemaFingerprint`` — opaque equality tokens
  folded into the SQL cell provenance hash
- ``register_adapter`` / ``get_adapter`` — driver registry

Per-driver implementations live in ``strata.notebook.sql.drivers.*``.
Each driver module registers its adapter at import time.
