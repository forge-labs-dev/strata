"""Fast I/O utilities for Arrow IPC stream operations.

This module provides optimized functions for Arrow IPC stream handling.
The cache now stores data in stream format, so the hot path for cache
hits is simply reading raw bytes (no Arrow parsing needed).

For concatenating multiple streams (multi-row-group scans), we provide:
- concat_stream_bytes: Buffered concatenation (returns all bytes at once)
- stream_concat_ipc_segments: True streaming (yields chunks incrementally)

The streaming version is preferred for large responses as it keeps memory
usage bounded to O(single segment) instead of O(total response).

Performance tuning:
- STRATA_FAST_CONCAT env var controls concat implementation:
  - "rust": Use Rust byte manipulation (zero-parse, fastest)
  - "pyarrow": Use PyArrow parsing (slower but handles edge cases)
  - Default: "rust" if available, else "pyarrow"

    This is the memory-efficient alternative to concat_stream_bytes().
    Instead of buffering the entire response, it yields chunks as they're
    produced, keeping memory usage bounded to O(single segment).

    Each input segment is a complete Arrow IPC stream (schema + batches + EOS).
    Output is a single IPC stream with all batches from all segments combined.

    Chunking strategy:
    - Buffer writes until we have at least min_chunk_size bytes
    - Yield on segment boundary only if buffer >= min_chunk_size/4 (avoids tiny chunks)
    - Always flush remaining data at end

    This avoids tiny yields (1-4 KB) that kill throughput while keeping
    memory bounded. The boundary threshold prevents small chunk overhead
    for narrow tables with tiny batches.

    Memory usage:
    - Peak: ~1 segment + min_chunk_size buffer
    - Output chunks are yielded when buffer threshold reached

    Enforcement hooks:
    - max_output_bytes: If total yielded bytes exceeds this, raises StreamLimitExceeded
    - deadline: If time.monotonic() exceeds this, raises StreamDeadlineExceeded

    These hooks ensure the stream is aborted (not silently truncated) when
    limits are exceeded. The caller should catch these exceptions and
    abort the HTTP connection.

        return StreamingResponse(

        max_output_bytes: Maximum total bytes to yield before aborting (None = no limit)
        deadline: Monotonic time deadline (from time.monotonic()) after which to abort

    Yields:
        bytes: Chunks of the combined IPC stream (schema, batches, EOS marker)

        StreamLimitExceeded: If max_output_bytes is exceeded
        StreamDeadlineExceeded: If deadline is exceeded
