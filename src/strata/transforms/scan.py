"""Scan transform (scan@v1) - identity read from Iceberg tables.

The scan transform reads data from an Iceberg table with optional:
- Column projection
- Row filtering
- Snapshot pinning

This is a "virtual" transform - it's handled internally by Strata's planner
and cache, not executed as a separate step. We define it here for:
1. Parameter validation
2. Documentation
3. Consistency with other transforms

Note: scan@v1 cannot be executed locally via Transform.execute() because
it requires access to the Iceberg catalog and Parquet files. The server
handles this transform specially.
