"""Tests for notebook module-export planning.

Module export takes a cell source and produces a "synthetic module" the
producing cell's defs/classes can be re-imported from in downstream
cells. The planner *slices* the source — keeps imports, defs, classes,
and literal-constant assignments; drops everything else — and validates
that the slice is self-contained (free vars in defs/classes resolve to
slice-local bindings or builtins). Cells that mix runtime work and
library code can export the library code cleanly; pure module cells
keep behaving exactly as before.
