"""Regression tests for semaphore/resource leak under client disconnects and timeouts.

This test suite ensures the server properly releases resources when:
- Clients disconnect mid-stream
- Clients timeout waiting for response
- Requests are cancelled

The bug this prevents:
- Semaphore slots were leaked when clients disconnected before the generator
  completed, causing the server to eventually return 503 for all requests.
- Fixed by moving resource tracking inside the generator with proper cleanup
  in GeneratorExit and CancelledError handlers.

These tests should be run as part of CI to prevent regression.
